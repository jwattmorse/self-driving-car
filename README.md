### Overview ###

In this project we hope to use the recently released Udacity self-driving car/behavioral emulation assignment in order to reimplement ALVINN using the keras python package. Once we implement ALVINN, the goal is then to build a self-driving car evaluation suite. This was one of the lacking features of the ALVINN paper and we hope to fill in the gaps. 

Once ALVINN has been thoroughly evaluated, the next stage is to do better! We will research deep learning techniques that will address the shortcomings our evaluation identifies. During this stage, we will design several candidate deep learning networks and/or network features and implement those that perform best. 

The final goal of the project is to learn TensorFlow and implement at least one of the networks weâ€™ve designed in this framework. Once implemented, we will apply our evaluation suite to each of the networks and to ALVINN.
